  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ECE is a rapidly advancing field, with new ideas emerging every other second. From mobile phones to remote sensing, there are exciting avenues to explore and create even better ideas. The ECE Department at G.K.C.E prepares students for careers in this constantly evolving discipline. The Department has specialists from the fields of Image Processing, Embedded systems, Communication systems, VLSI Design, Wireless & Mobile Communications etc. The department has well equipped laboratories offering good infrastructure to conduct experiments in all fields and we have generated additional experiments apart from the JNTUA curriculum to impart more practical training to students.
<br><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Every year about 90% of eligible students are securing placements and the department is surging ahead to achieve 100% placements through on and off campus placements. At present department is running a full time UG program in ECE, one full time PG program in Digital Electronics & Communication Systems (DECS) specialization and one II shift Diploma course(DECE). The department has embarked research activities in the fields of
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Signal & Image Processing
<li>VLSI & Embedded systems
<li>Computer Networking & Communications
<li>Wireless & Mobile Communications and looking forward to have tie-ups with companies/ Industries in these fields to carry out and develop research these fields.
</ul>
    
	<li>In every summer vacation pre-final year students prepare working models in all the fields of ECE discipline. Technical experts are invited for National level Students Symposium to enhance the technical knowledge of the students in diversified fields. GKCE students designed and developed the working model on GSM based Digital Display system and trials are on to embed voice control. Every year the Department is successfully conducting National level student symposiums. The biannual news letter ELCOM released by ECE Department gives opportunity to the students to bring on their proficiency and explore skills by way of contributing articles on various subjects.
