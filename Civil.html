		<h2><u>About The Department</u></h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Civil Engineering was started in the academic year 2014. Civil engineering is the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering, and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering. It is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including works like roads, bridges, canals, dams, and buildings etc. Until modern times there was no clear distinction between civil engineering and architecture, and the term engineer and architect were mainly geographical variations referring to the same occupation, and often used interchangeably. In the 18th century, the term civil engineering was coined to incorporate all things civilian as opposed to military engineering. Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines such as:

<ul>
<li>Geotechnical Engineering
<li>Transportation Engineering
<li>Environmental Engineering
<li>Water Resources Engineering
<li>Strength of Materials
<li>Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulic Machines
<li>Surveying
<li>Hydrology
<li>Structural Analysis
<li>Design of Reinforced Concrete structures, Steel structures, Irrigation structures and much more.
</ul>
<br>
The department has excellent infrastructure facilities and modern laboratories. The department has maintains a close liaison with industries and ensures that students are trained as for global requirements.
